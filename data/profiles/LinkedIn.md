Summary
hello!
I am Yongtae Hwang, Korean but born and grow up in Japan.
Now I am a Senior Full-stack Machine Learning Engineer.
You can see my computation skills here (https://github.com/Yongtae723)

Now my interests are below
・I want to contribute to a successful product in the global market.
・I want to know what is a key factor of a successful organization and want to build a great team.

-------------
My strength

・Ability to solve even abstract tasks.
 ・I always make an effort to understand what the product wants to achieve and create an AI that achieves its goals, even if the goals are abstract.

・Understanding the importance of each member's ideas, and the ability to successfully integrate them into product improvements.
 ・I believe that when we aggregate the ideas of various members, we can arrive at great ideas that one person could not come up with alone. I can make an environment where members can easily come up with ideas for product improvement and aggregate them flexibly.

・Creating a system to speed up development and experimentation.
 ・I believe speed is one of the most important factors to make a great product. so that I led to made train/deploy template code. by using the same template code for the team, we focused on increasing the readability of the code among members, preventing others from doing someone else's hard work, and increasing the speed of development

・Experience outside of AI
 ・I have a bachelor's degree in theoretical physics and degree of master's and Ph.D. in the field of biophysics with single molecular experience and simulation (you can see my paper from my publication).
